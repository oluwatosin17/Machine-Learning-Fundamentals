    "\n",
    "A simple way to test the quality of your model is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "split the dataset into 2 partitions:\n",
    "1. the training set: contains the majority of the rows (75%)\n",
    "2. the test set: contains the remaining minority of the rows (25%)\n",

    "\n",
    "This validation process, where we use the training set to make predictions and the test set to predict values for, is known as train/test validation. Whenever you're performing machine learning, you want to perform validation of some kind to ensure that your machine learning model can make good predictions on new data. While train/test validation isn't perfect, we'll use it to understand the validation process, to select an error metric, and then we'll dive into a more robust validation process later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's modify the predict_price function to use only the rows in the training set, instead of the full dataset, to find the nearest neighbors, average the price values for those rows, and return the predicted price value. Then, we'll use this function to predict the price for just the rows in the test set. Once we have the predicted price values, we can compare with the true price values"

In general, we should expect that the MAE value be much less than the RMSE value. The only difference between the 2 sets of errors is the extreme 1000 value in errors_two instead of 10. When we're working with larger data sets, we can't inspect each value to understand if there's one or some outliers or if all of the errors are systematically higher. Looking at the ratio of MAE to RMSE can help us understand if there are large but infrequent errors. You can read more about comparing MAE and RMSE in this wonderful post."
